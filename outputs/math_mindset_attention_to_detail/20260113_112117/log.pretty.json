What is that like?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe weight of that habit settles in, a gentle but insistent presence in the back of my mind. It's as if I've been carrying a small, unassuming stone in my pocket for years, and it's only now that I'm starting to feel its weight. The stone is a reminder of all the times I've let my guard down, allowed myself to be swayed by a fleeting impression, and followed it down a path that's often led me to places I wouldn't have chosen.\n\nAs I sit with this habit, I feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me. I remember the first time it happened, the way my heart skipped a beat as I met someone new, and my mind immediately began to form an opinion about them. It was as if I'd been given a snapshot of their entire personality in that one moment, and I'd accepted it without question. I recall the way I'd feel a sense of excitement and anticipation, as if I'd stumbled upon a secret that no one else knew.\n\nBut now, as I reflect on those moments, I can see the pattern emerging. I'd let my emotions cloud my judgment, and before I knew it, I'd be investing myself in a relationship or a friendship that wasn't quite right for me"
