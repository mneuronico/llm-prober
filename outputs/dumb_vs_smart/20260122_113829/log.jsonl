Evaluate the expression within parentheses:\n\n   49 * 92 = 4484\n\n2. Calculate the expression:\n\n   (4484 * 77) = 336,245,064\n\n3. Subtract 46 from the result:\n\n   336,245,064 - 46 = 336,245,018\n\n**ANSWER**: 336,245,018", "prompt_len": 91, "layers": [11], "npz_path": "C:\\Users\\Nico\\Documents\\GitHub\\llm-prober\\outputs\\dumb_vs_smart\\20260122_113829\\math_eval_mixed_ops_5x2\\batch_20260125_163016\\prompt_019_Solve_the_arithmetic_expression._Show_brief_work_sigmap100p00.npz", "html_path": "C:\\Users\\Nico\\Documents\\GitHub\\llm-prober\\outputs\\dumb_vs_smart\\20260122_113829\\math_eval_mixed_ops_5x2\\batch_20260125_163016\\prompt_019_Solve_the_arithmetic_expression._Show_brief_work_sigmap100p00.html"}
