For internet, compare local ISPs for their lowest‑price bundles (often 25–30 USD/month for basic speeds) and ask if they have a student or “single‑unit” discount, or use a nearby co‑working space’s Wi‑Fi for the first few weeks to avoid a contract. A cheap way to stay cozy is to add a few texture pieces—think a woven throw draped over the futon, a small floor‑level rug (you can find low‑cost options at thrift stores), and a hanging macramé plant holder with a low‑maintenance succulent; these add warmth without taking up floor space. Finally, use floating shelves with LED strips for both storage and ambient"

One more tip: consider energy-efficient options like LED bulbs, power strips, and smart plugs to minimize energy waste and save on your utility bills. Also, don't forget to take advantage of tax deductions for utility bills if you're a renter.

They can help you determine what expenses qualify and guide you through the process. For a compact backup power source, consider a portable power bank, a battery-powered lantern, or a USB-powered inverter. These can be found at affordable prices online or at local electronics stores.

Do you think I should also grab a compact LED lantern for emergencies, or would the power bank cover everything?

For budgeting, utilities can account for 30-40% of your first month's expenses, while groceries will be around 20-30%. Consider setting aside a small buffer for unexpected expenses. For utilities, aim to budget around 10-15% of your total moving costs."
