Roommate search: Websites like Roommate Finder or Craigslist can connect you with potential roommates.\n6. Government assistance: Some cities offer subsidized housing programs or Section 8 vouchers.\n7.

Websites like Zillow or Trulia often have listings that match your budget, and apartment complexes may offer discounts for short-term leases.\n\nRegarding negotiating a short-term lease, here are some tips:\n\n1. Be flexible: Show that you're willing to sign a lease for a shorter term (e.g., 3-6 months) to demonstrate your commitment to the property.\n2. Emphasize your stability: Highlight your job, income, and any other stable aspects of your life to reassure the landlord.\n3. Ask about discounts: Request a discount for the shorter lease term, as some landlords may be willing to negotiate.\n4. Inspect the property: Before signing a lease, make sure to inspect the property for any damages or issues, and request that the landlord cover any repairs.\n5. Consider a roommate: If you're unable to afford the full rent on your own, consider finding a roommate to split the cost.\n\nWhen negotiating, be respectful and professional. Remember that landlords may have limited options, so be prepared to compromise."

Some cities with a relatively low cost of living include:\n\n* Portland, Oregon\n* Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n* Omaha, Nebraska\n* Des Moines, Iowa\n\nIn terms of neighborhoods, some areas that are often more affordable include:\n\n* Up-and-coming neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city\n* Older buildings or apartments that have been converted into modern units\n* Neighborhoods with a high student population (e.g., near universities)\n\nKeep in mind that these are general suggestions, and the best neighborhood for you will depend on your personal preferences and priorities.\n\nWhich city or region are you considering moving to?
