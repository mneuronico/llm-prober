Here’s a quick outline for Day 2 in Tokyo:\n\n1. **Morning** – Tsukiji outer market: grab fresh sushi for breakfast and sample tamago‑yaki (sweet omelet).  \n2. **Mid‑day** – Walk to Ginza for a quick coffee, then head to Shinjuku; stop at a tonkatsu‑mae (tonkatsu‑specialized) spot for lunch (look for a “katsu‑don” set).  \n3. **Afternoon** – Explore Kabukicho: start with a takoyaki stand, then try a yakitori bar (order “negima” and “tsukune”). Finish with a small dessert shop serving matcha‑flavored crepes or mochi.  \n4. **Evening** – End the crawl at a rooftop izakaya with a view of the neon skyline, maybe a “shochu” tasting.\n\nWould you like"

If you prefer a more laid‑back vibe, try the **Shōchū Lounge** inside the **Tokyo Shinjuku Granbell Hotel**; they serve a “flight” of three styles with a side of citrus zest to cleanse the palate between sips.

After the ceremony, you might stroll along Shirakawa‑dōri to see the machiya houses and perhaps stop for a light snack of yatsuhashi sweets.

A classic spot is **Yudofu Sagano** near the Tenryū‑ji temple; they serve the tofu in a light kombu‑dashi broth with toppings like grated daikon, scallions, and a drizzle of yuzu‑soy sauce, and the garden view adds a peaceful finish to the day. If you still have room for a bite afterward, wander to **Nishiki Market** and try a few stalls of **tsukemen** (cold noodles with a rich, pork‑based dipping broth) or the tiny croquette‑style snack called **okonomiyaki‑like “okiriyaki”** that many locals love. This combo gives you both a traditional sit‑down experience and a lively street‑food finish."
